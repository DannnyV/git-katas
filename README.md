This repository contains scripts that are able to generate a git repository in different situations in order to allow you to practice resolving them.

## What do I need?

In order for these scripts to work, you will need to have `git` installed. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/).

There are slight differences between Windows' Batch scripts and Shell scripts that run on GNU/Linux. Make sure you run the scripts for your system.

## What situations are available?

Currently there are the following situations:

- Merge conflict
- Accidental commit into a wrong branch
- A branch with one of the older commits being unwanted (should move to a different branch)
- üí° **Some you came up with.** _If you have an idea, create an issue or pull request the script._ üòä

## How does it work?

These scripts utilize the `git` command and common system tools to create a new repo, write files, commit them as different fake users, create branches, etc. To quickly setup the desired state.

When you make a mistake, or just want to start over, you can delete the repository folder generated and generate it with the script again.

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute your own situation, refactor the existing ones, create issue for ideas, questions, or comments you have about the project.

Anyone is welcome to participate. ‚ù§
